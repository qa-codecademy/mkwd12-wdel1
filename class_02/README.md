# Module 2 - Setup of the Next.js project

In this module we are setting up the Next.js project. We are going to use the [shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) library to speed up the development process. We are going to build the whole skeleton of the project, and we are going to show the sidebar, and the feed of the twitter app. For starters, we will use mock data, and later we will connect to the database.
