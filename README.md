# Web Development Elective - Next JS :rocket:

This is the repository for the elective subject "Full Stack Development with Next JS" as part of the third semester of the Web Development academy at Qinshift Academy. During this elective we will create a full stack web application that is going to be a clone of the popular Twitter web application, mimicking its core functionalities.

## Table of Contents

These are the modules, that are going to be covered in this elective (the number doesn't represent a class number).

1. Quick introduction to Backend Development with JavaScript using Node.js and Express
2. Introduction to React and Next JS Frameworks
3. Creating APIs to provide data to the Next JS Frontend
4. Connecting to PostgreSQL and using Drizzle ORM
5. Authentication and Authorization
6. Quick and easy Deployment
7. TBD... :wink:

## Prerequisites for this subject

- Great understanding of web development
- Good understanding of HTML & CSS
- Good understanding of JavaScript
- Basic understanding of REST API
- Basic understanding of SQL

Even though this subject is intended for students who were part of the JavaScript track, it is not mandatory to know JS/TS frameworks to be able to follow this elective. Of course, obviously is a plus if you have experience with TypeScript, React and/or Node.js, but even without it you should be able to follow the elective with dedication and willingness to learn.

## Why you should learn Next JS

Next JS is the currently most popular framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) React applications. It's the modern way to quickly build scalable web applications. Even though is fairly new, it has already gained a lot of popularity and adoption by big companies like Vercel. Even if you don't end up using it after this elective, it's a good skill to have under your belt, as it will be a very good addition to your skillset.

As Next JS is a React framework, it's also a good way to get familiar with React, which is the most popular library for building user interfaces.
