# Module 3 - DB, Rest APIs, Routing

In this module we will start by creating the database for the twitter app. We will explore options on how to store and query data, and how to use them in the application.

Than we are going to create the rest APIs for the twitter app, but also see how we can fetch data directly from the database without using the API. This will provide info about the basic differences between the two approaches, using client VS server components, it's pros and cons, and how to use them.

On top of that, we will explore the concept of routing, and how to use it to create a clean and scalable application. In Next.js we have a wide range of options to handle routing, but we will focus on the most common ones and the ones that are mostly used in the industry.
